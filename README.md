# tensor

An infinite dimensional tensor package.
```python
>>> from tensor import Tensor
>>> t = Tensor(((1, 2), (3, 4)))
>>> t
Tensor[[1 2]
       [3 4]]
>>> s = Tensor(((1,), (2,)))
>>> s
Tensor[[1]
       [2]]
>>> t + s
Tensor[[2 2]
       [5 4]]
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/tensor.git
```

## Usage

This package provides a single class, `Tensor`, to handle infinite dimensional tensors.
A tensor can be initialized in three ways:
 - With the constructor `Tensor(coef)` that takes an array like object (something that is accepted by `numpy.asarray`) and wraps it into a tensor.
 - With the basis factors `Tensor.basis_tensor(d0, d1, ...)` that returns a tensor full of zeros and a one in the specified position.
 - With the random factory `Tensor.random(d0, d1, ...)` for a random tensor of the given dimensionality.
The objects are immutable (coefficients are internally stored in a write protected `numpy.array`) and zero-indexed.
```python
>>> from vector import Vector
>>> v = Vector((1, 2, 3))
>>> w = Vector.random(3)
>>> v
Vector(1, 2, 3, 0, ...)
>>> w
Vector(-0.5613820142699765, -0.028308921297709365, 0.8270724508948077, 0, ...)
>>> Vector.basis_tuple(3)
(0, 0, 0, 1)
```

Tensor object have
- a rank: `t.rank` &
- a shape: `t.shape`.

Container and sequence interfaces are implemented so the coefficients can be
- accessed by indexing: `t[2, 3]` (coefficients not set return to 0),
- casted to an array (implements `__array__`),
- compared: `t == s` (tuple of coefficients get compared),
- shifted: `t >> (3, 4), t << (1, 2)`,
- trimmed: `t.trim()` (trailing non-zero coefficients get removed) &
- rounded: `t.round(2)`.

Hilbert space operations are provided:
- Vector addition & subtraction `t + s, t - s` &
- scalar multiplication & division `2 * t, t / 2`.
The multiplicative operations are overloaded to perform scalar multiplication/division if the other argument is a scalar, or elementwise multiplication/division if both operands are `Tensors`s, `t * s`.

## Design decisions

The `Tensor` class not only wrapps a `numpy.array`, but also tries as best as
possible to use the standard built-in Python types (`int`, `float`, ...).
This makes calculations slower, but keeps arithmetic Python features
like unbounded integers.
